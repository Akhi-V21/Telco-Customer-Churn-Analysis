# Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying patterns in customer attrition and building a predictive model to help a telecommunications company reduce churn.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **Task_1_.ipynb**: Data Cleaning (handling missing values, encoding).
- **Task_2.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Demographic trends.
- **Task_4.ipynb**: Machine Learning (Logistic Regression model - 82% Accuracy).
- **Task_6.ipynb**: Advanced Visualizations (Box plots, Violin plots).

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Contract Risk:** Month-to-month contracts are the biggest driver of churn.
- **Price Sensitivity:** High monthly charges correlate with higher churn.
- **Model Performance:** The Logistic Regression model provides a reliable prediction for at-risk customers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Visual 1: The Problem at a Glance This chart shows how many customers stayed (No) vs. how many left (Yes). We see that about 26% of our customers are leaving. This is the problem my project aims to solve by predicting who will leave next

Visual 2: The Main Driver of Churn This is my biggest finding: Customers on Month-to-month contracts are the most likely to leave.
Insight: Long-term contracts (1 or 2 years) act as a "lock," keeping customers loyal. Short-term plans are the highest risk for the company.

Visual 3: The Price Factor Here, we see that customers who leave generally pay higher monthly bills than those who stay.
Insight: High costs are driving people away. To keep customers, the company might need to offer loyalty discounts to high-paying users.

Visual 4: The AI Solution This is a "Confusion Matrix" which proves my Machine Learning model is working.
Result: The model is 82% accurate. This means the company can now use this tool to automatically flag "at-risk" customers and offer them a promotion before they officially quit

## 📈 Summary Report
My analysis found that **expensive, short-term contracts** are the biggest reason for losing customers. 

By using the **Predictive Model** I developed:
1. The company can predict with **82% certainty** who will leave.
2. We can target high-paying, month-to-month customers with better loyalty offers.
3. This shifts the business from "reacting" to lost customers to "preventing" the loss before it happens.
